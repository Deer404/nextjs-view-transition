## Installation

To install this modified version of next-view-transitions, use your preferred package manager. For example:

```bash
npm install nextjs-view-transition
# or
yarn add nextjs-view-transition
# or
pnpm install nextjs-view-transition
```

## Usage

Wrap your content with the `<ViewTransitions>` component inside the layout file:

```jsx
import { ViewTransitions } from 'nextjs-view-transition'

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <ViewTransitions>
      <html lang='en'>
        <body>
          {children}
        </body>
      </html>
    </ViewTransitions>
  )
}
```

Then, use the `<TransitionLink>` component for links that need to trigger a view transition:

```jsx
import { TransitionLink } from "nextjs-view-transition";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <TransitionLink href='/book'>Go to book page</TransitionLink>
    </div>
  )
}
```
